This is the Sun SPOT crypto library. It partially implements the SATSA 1.0 (JSR 177)  specification.
<h2> Optional SATSA packages</h2>
<h3>Supported</h3>
<ul><li>SATSA-CRYPTO Optional Packags<br>
The optional package SATSA-CRYPTO is a subset of the Java 2 platform, Standard
Edition (J2SE) Cryptography API. When this optional package&nbsp;is implemented
on a CDC/FP based platform that already supports some of the classes in
this optional package, the whole API is the union of the API&nbsp;in the
CDC/FP and the API&nbsp;in the SATSA-CRYPTO&nbsp;optional package.<br>
This package is partially supported. See <a href="#differences">Differences to SATSA</a> for details.</li></ul>

<p>
<h3> Not supported</h3>
  <ul>
        <li>SATSA-APDU</li>
        <li>SATSA-JCRMI</li>
        <li>SATSA-PKI</li>
	</ul>
	
<h2>Implemented algorithms</h2>
<h3>Ciphers</h3>
<ul>
    <li>AES<br>ECB, CBC modes, no padding</li>
    <li>RC4</li>

 </ul>
  
<h3>Message digest</h3>
<ul>
   <li>SHA-1</li>
    <li>MD5</li>
 </ul>

<h3>Signature</h3>
	<ul>
   <li>Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm (ECDSA)<br>
        <code>SHA1WITHECDSA</code>,<code>MD5WITHECDSA</code></li>
    <li>RSA (slow, use ECC instead if possible, in particular for private key operations)<br>
        <code>SHA1WITHRSA</code>, MD5WITHRSA</code></li>
   </ul>
<h2>Algorithm Details</h2>
<h3>Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC)</h3>
    The elliptic curve algorithms only supports SECP160R1 which is defined over a 160-bit NIST prime fields.
    Other elliptic curves, prime field sizes or general reduction primes are not supported, respectively without 
    fast reduction implementation, which makes them very slow (SECP192R1, SECP256R1). To make these 
    fesable to use, or  to add additional  curves over NIST prime field, the according modulo reduction must be 
    implemented, as it is done in NIST160PrimeField.java for the currently supported field.
<h3>RSA</RSA></h3>
    The RSA crypto is not very well  suited for small devices like the Sun SPOTs. It is only included
    for compatibility with existing systems (like https servers), instead ECC should be used. RSA is in particular
    slow for private key operations like signing, while its performance is acceptable for public key operations, if
    a small exponent is used, which is usually the case.<p>
    The basic arithmetic operation which determines RSA performance  is modulo exponentiation. The implementation
    uses a stripped down version of the CDC BigInteger and MutableBigInteger class. Although the size of the modulo
    exponentiation class could be significantly reduced by removing all functionality not required in RSA, it still accounts
    for a significant share of the library size, namely  about 12 kByte of the 95 kByte library suite file size.<p>
    For applications were the size of the library is critical, and the RSA performance is not important, for example
    because ECC is used instead,  it may make sense
    to remove the com.sun.spotx.crypto.implementation.ModuloExponentiation class and to change the
    com.sun.spotx.crypto.implementation.RSA class to use the  class method modExpFFA instead. This reduces
    the size of the library by using a much simpler, and much slower modulo exponentiation algorithm. The performance hit is higher
    for larger exponents, which makes it infeasible to use the simple algorithm for private key operations (~10 minutes in
    comparison to ~20 s with the default algorithm for a 1024-bit exponent). For small exponents, as commonly used
    for public  key operations, the performance hit still high although  smaller (~0.5s in comparison to 10s for a 16-bit exponent.)

<h2><a name="differences"></a>Differences to SATSA</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Package names<br>
        Not using the <code>java.*</code> but <code>spot.*</code>. This is primarily for compliance reasons, as the crypto library doesn't support SATSA entirely.
        Furthermore  it allows the use of the library in host applications, while using the <code>java.*</code> package name wouldn't work.</li>
   <li><code>KeyFactory</code> and <code>KeySpec</code>s not supported<br>
        In difference to SATSA does the SPOT crypto library not differentiate     between opaque keys of type <code>Key</code>  and transparent
        key specifications. KeyGenerator would be required to convert KeySpecs to opaque keys and thus is not used.<br>>
        This also implies that X509 encoded are not supported, and the keys have to be created in an algorithm dependent manner.
        This only applies to asymmetric keys. In the case of  symmetric keys, even the SATSA specification  combines the opaque key and the transparent
        specification in one class, which is called SecretKeySpec.</li>
   <li><code>Signature</code><br>
        Signing is supported. In SATSA a separate class <code>CMSMessageSignatureService</code>
        is used for signing instead. To simplify the interface to the crypto library instead signing support was added to the Signature class, which
        is also consistent with the JCE.<br>
        In the SATSA specification the Signature class is defined as abstract, while all methods are final. As there is not direct benefit with this and
        the class is not SATSA compliant anyway, the methods were not made final but were kept abstract.</li>
   <li><code>PrivateKey</code><br>
        SATSA only defines a <code>PublicKey</code> class, to support <code>SignatureSign.sign()</code> in a consistent manner and for general 
        consistency a <codePrivateKey</code> interface was added.</li>
    <li><code>java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException</code> not supported</li>
    <li>Support of <code>KeyAgreement</code><br>
        The Sun SPOT crypto library supports key agreement with elliptic curve keys. To do this  the class <code>KeyAgreement</code> was added to the com.sun.spotx.crypto
        package was added.
      </ul></li>
       
<h2>Interoperability with  MIDP SSL</h2>
    The Sun SPOT crypto library was tested with the SSL reference liberation in MIDP (cougar). This interoperability was actually
    one of the main design goals, which also leaded to  the decision to implement the SATSA specification, which is used by the SSL
    code. The SSL code  has same special dependencies on the implementation of the crypto library, mainly on the implementation of
    keys. This has been considered when modifying the crypto library, except that SecretKey was removed, as it is equivalent to
    <code>SecretKeySpec</code> defined by the SATSA specification. Thus references to <code>SecretKey</code> in the SSL code have
    to be replaced by <code>SecretKeySpec</code>.
    Furthermore the package names are different, as neither the Sun SPOT crypto  library nor the MIDP crypto library use the names defined
    by the SATSA specification.
 <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
This crypto library is based on the  previous Sun SPOT crypto library and the  MIDP cougar code. MIDP itself
follows for the most part the SATSA specification, while the previous Sun SPOT crypto library
uses the  javacard interface.<p>These two libraries where merged together and adapted according to the SATSA
specification. Most algorithm implementations, including ECC, originate from the previous Sun SPOT crypto library, while some implementations,
in particular, RSA originate from the MIDP code. The MIDP RSA implementation used a native modulo exponentiation algorithm,
which was replaced by a stripped down version of <code>BigInteger</code> and <code>MutableBigInteger</code> from the Java CDC
class library.
<p>
The <code>test</code> package contains JUnit tests to allow testing of the library.
