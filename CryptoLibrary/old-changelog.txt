06/09/22 Christian Puhringer 
	Added basic support for SECP256R1 and SECP192R1 elliptic curves.
	No fast reduction was implemented, therefore it is very slow. 
	Additional tests added. 
06/09/15 Christian Puhringer (CVS tag: satsa)
Moved implementation specific classes from com.sun.spot.security 
and com.sun.spot.crypto to com.sun.spot.security.implementation
respectively com.sun.spotx.crypto.implementation.

06/09/14  Christian Puhringer
Stripped down MutableBigInteger and BigInteger and
merged into ModuloExponentiation class.
-06/09/13  Christian Puhringer
Merged Michael Wurm's crypto library with cougar MIDP code
and adapted according to SATSA specification. Replaced 
native modulo exponentiation by using BigInteger
and MutableBigInteger from CDC class library.

com.sun.spot.security:
	DigestException
		OK
	GeneralSecurityException
		OK
	InvalidAlgorithmParameterException
		OK
	InvalidKeyException
		OK
	Key (copied javadoc from spec)
	   OK
	KeyException (changed super class from CryptoException to GeneralSecurityException)
		OK
	NoSuchAlgorithm
		OK
	PublicKey (Replaced javadoc with spec javadoc)
		OK
	PrivateKey
		OK (Not in spec)
	SignatureException
		OK
	MessageDigest
		Replaced (incorrect) update javadoc with javadoc from spec. 
		clone,  getAlgorithm, and getDigestLength   not part of specification
		  OK
	Signature
		Replaced initVerify javadoc with spec javadoc
		Replaced update javadoc with spec javadoc. (adding a "and signing")
		Added a warning to the javadoc of methods not in the spec		
		sign, initSign, getAlgorithm, and getLength not part of specification
		Difference to SATSA
			Some methods should be final
			However, the class itself should be abstract. Strange.
			Perhaps revisit the javadoc of the two sign methods. => ignore this
	KeyFactory (Perhaps just skip this)
	 (		Added
		Additional method generatePrivate added (not in spec)
		add supported key factories to getInstance() (Perhaps just skip this) )
		Removed from lib
			
com.sun.spot.security.spec:
	AlgorithmParameterSpec  (moved from com.sun.spot.security)
		 OK
	InvalidKeySpecException
		OK
	KeySpec
		Added. (it is just an empty interface, javadoc copied from spec)
		OK	
	(EncodedKeySpec 
		Added
		OK
	X509EncodedKeySpec 
		Added
		Supposed to support privates key as well in difference to spec
		TODO: add javadoc for private key (really?)
	) => REMOVED	
	MD5 (not in spec)		
	SHA (not in spec)
	SecureRandom (not in spec)
	PseudoRand (not in spec) (move?)
com.sun.spotx.crypto
	Moved from com.sun.spot.security:
		BadPaddingException
		IllegalBlockSizeException
		NoSuchPaddingException
		ShortBufferException (and removed reference to no algorithm found in javadoc, 
				this info is also in the spec, but doesn't make sense for the exception)
		OK	
	Cipher
		Copied class javadoc from specification
		Made member methods final, by using new CipherSpi
		
	CipherSpi (newly created, not in spec)		
	RsaMd5Sig (not in spec)
	RsaShaSig (not in spec)
	RSASig (not in spec)
	Changed to packet private, to hide in javadoc. (similar 
	TODO: reconsider the three rsa signature classes	they should be, and whether they 
		can be merged into one class. 

	ECDSASignature
		Replaced KeyPair references. (by just using two separate keys)
		Direct access to key fields replaced by getter calls
	ECDSAWithMD5Signature
	ECDSAWithSHA1Signature
	TODO: reconsider the 3 ECDSA classes where they should be, and whether they 
		can be merged into one class. 
	
com.sun.spotx.crypto.spec
	 IvParameterSpec 
	 		Renamed IvParamer copied from com.sun.spot.security
	 		Changed superclass from CryptoParameter to AlgorithmParameterSpec
	 		(This means the class now differes from midp cougar)
	SecretKeySpec
			Renamed SecretKey
			Replaced class javadoc with javadoc from spec.
			Replaced constructor javadoc with javadoc from spec. (only slightly different).
