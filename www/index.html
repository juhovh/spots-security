<p>This is where the open source development of the security related code for SPOTs will take place. All available code can accessed by clicking on the <a href="https://spots-security.dev.java.net/source/browse/spots-security/">Subversion</a> link on the left. The Sun SPOT SDK already supports code authentication using digital signatures.  This code is available inside the <a href="https://spots-security.dev.java.net/source/browse/spots-security/trunk/DesktopSigning/">DesktopSigning</a> module. We've also developed code to implement SSL/TLS for encrypted communication between SPOTs and between SPOTs and clients/servers on the Internet. This code is now available as a technology preview but isn't included by default within the SPOT SDK. Please refer to the <a href="https://spots-security.dev.java.net/source/browse/spots-security/trunk/SSL/readme.txt">readme.txt</a> file inside the SSL module for instructions on experimenting with the SSL/TLS code.</p> 

<p><strong>Roadmap</strong></p>  <p>The SSL/TLS code offers secure communication capability over streams (e.g. radiostream or TCP). We are looking for help from our community to add DTLS (i.e. a TLS derivative called Datagram TLS, see <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4347.txt">RFC 4347</a>) support which would extend the secure communication capability to radiograms and UDP. <em>More to come ...</em></p>

<p><strong>How to participate</strong></p>    <p>Discussions on bugs or new functionality should take place on the SunSpotWorld <a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/forums">Forums</a>, generally in the <a href="https://www.sunspotworld.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=25">Sun SPOT Software</a> forum.</p>    <p>Technical discussions about the actual code in the various system libraries takes place on the dev@spots-security.dev.java.net mailing list.</p>

Before requesting a membership role please first post a note introducing yourself on the <a href="https://www.sunspotworld.com/forums/viewforum.php?f=19">Sun SPOT Projects forum</a> on <a href="http://www.sunspotworld.com/">www.sunspotworld.com</a>. Like most open source projects people wanting write access to the svn repository first need to demonstrate that they understand the current code and the project's coding practices. This is generally done through participation on the project's mailing list and the SunSpotWorld Forums, including reporting bugs and posting patches.</p>     <p><strong>For more information</strong></p>    <p>Please send any questions, comments or suggestions to <a href="mailto:vipul_gupta@dev.java.net">vipul_gupta</a> or to any of the other project owners. </p>
